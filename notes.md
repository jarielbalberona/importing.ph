Personally, my problem is with the tracking and the realtime update.
Right now, shipper doesnt really update me or even the tracking page is not up to date.
When I get busy, I cant follow up my shipments resulting to long shipment time if ever they did not shipped it or missed the shipping.

Sol: Implement AI Workflow, maybe using n8n or langchain to automatically follow shipper or update the tracking, etc
